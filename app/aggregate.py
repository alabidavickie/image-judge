"""Combine N independent judge runs into one verdict. Pure logic, no I/O.

Rules (never force an answer when runs disagree):
  confident - every planned run succeeded, all chose the same result, none
              reported low confidence, and at least 2 runs (so both A/B orders
              were seen).
  review    - a strict majority of *planned* runs chose the same result.
              The verdict is shown as a leaning, for a human to check.
  unclear   - anything else (e.g. a 2-2 split). No verdict.
  error     - no run succeeded.
